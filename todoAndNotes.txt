Todo:
Sprites
World building
Leveling up
Stats + perks

Notes:
Models folder too large for github

Camera:
Ortographic -> less modeling work, not so immersive, less work on exact positioning of models
Perspective -> More indepth world, a lot more modeling work

Gameplay style:
2d / 2.5d? -> 2d for now

Art style:
Pixelated, how can I make models and animations? sprites make keyframing easier
cartoon, same as pixelated but cleaner
"realistic", can use free models aivailable in many places for items, inconsistancy, keyframing harder


WHAT IF
instead of zombies, have the game take place in space, 
spacecraft require less animating and can be self created easier, 
all weapons and mechanics can be re-used

Weapons:
Classes or everything aivailable?
Weapons could be divided into classes which would reduce coding requirements for switching between etc
also would allow for more challenges instead of using the best one possible

Perks:
Speed
damage
health
health regen?
projectile size? type?

Mobs:
Melee "zombie"
Ranged caster, reach X range from player, shoot projectiles -> indicators?
