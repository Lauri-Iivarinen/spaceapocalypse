--------------------------------------------


Todo:
Levels and level selection
Saving progress
Level progression
New mobs
Leveling up gives Stats + perks

Notes:
Models folder too large for github

Camera:
Ortographic -> less modeling work, not so immersive, less work on exact positioning of models
Perspective -> More indepth world, a lot more modeling work

Gameplay style:
2d / 2.5d? -> 2d for now

Art style:
Pixelated, how can I make models and animations? sprites make keyframing easier
cartoon, same as pixelated but cleaner
"realistic", can use free models aivailable in many places for items, inconsistancy, keyframing harder


WHAT IF
instead of zombies, have the game take place in space, 
spacecraft require less animating and can be self created easier, 
all weapons and mechanics can be re-used

Weapons:
Classes or everything aivailable?
Weapons could be divided into classes which would reduce coding requirements for switching between etc
also would allow for more challenges instead of using the best one possible

Buffs:
Speed
damage

health
health regen?
penetration
attack speed
crit chance
crit dmg

Mobs:
Melee "zombie"
Ranged caster, reach X range from player, shoot projectiles -> indicators?
Melee, fast, low hp
Ranged, chargeup, line aoe, line needs rescaling in gimp, 64x64

TODO Mobs:
Melee, aoe pulse
Ranged, "channel", low damage, cant be dodged unless OOR (or behind asteroid mby)


Bosses:
At the end of the fight
Ignore asteroids
Big healthbar on screen
Drops an item?
Boss1:
- Cast shield, immortal
- Spin around, multiple projectiles in spirals
- Charge frontal
- Drop mines, can take self damage, breaks shield
Boss2:
- Aoe nuke, can be dodged behind asteroid (destroyed after?)
- Triple frontal, 5 areas 3/5 random
- Shoot normal bullets
- Overlaps?

Game Mechanics:
Rocket boost, fast speedup if needed to run away/dodge mechanics etc, uses fuel, fuel charges overtime.
Game specific powerups (balls/needles in HoT)
 - Flamethrower on thrusters
 - Forward shot, automated, many bullets? shotgun?
 - Mines, automated, drops still mine that explodes aoe
 - EMP, aoe pulse
 - 360 spinning beam on intervals
Post match powerups/items for long term progression?
