  No idea how to develop games in Unity and only small experience with C# in the form of a couple leetcode problems, however my experience with Java will help.
  <li>Multiple hours of YouTube tutorials later I have Unity open and a project running</li>
  <li>Project has different objects with different properties</li>
  <li>Player can move around</li>
  <li>Player can turn towards cursor</li>
  <li>Player can shoot projectiles towards cursor</li>
  <li>Player can damage 'Zombies'</li>
  <li>Player can take damage from 'Zombies'</li>
  <li>Rough sketch for UI to test how different classes interact</li>
