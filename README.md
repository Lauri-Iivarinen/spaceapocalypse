# Journey to Unity and C# game development

This readme will be in a form of a diary of sorts where I track the progress I have made in Unity and C#


## Idea is to make a 2d roguelike where player fights waves of zombies and can gain perks when leveling up

  No idea how to develop games in Unity and only small experience with C# in the form of a couple leetcode problems, however my experience with Java will help.
  <li>Multiple hours of YouTube tutorials later I have Unity open and a project running</li>
  <li>Project has different objects with different properties</li>
  <li>Player can move around</li>
  <li>Player can turn towards cursor</li>
  <li>Player can shoot projectiles towards cursor</li>
  <li>Player can damage 'Zombies'</li>
  <li>Player can take damage from 'Zombies'</li>
  <li>Rough sketch for UI to test how different classes interact</li>

  Continued where I left off, sketched new model prototypes, need to create sprites soon. A lot of tutorials on YouTube which help a lot. Planning to extend player stats building. Need to look into different views (Menu/death screen etc.)
  <li>Removed excess models from the world and created prefabs</li>
  <li>Mobs spawn on timer and outside of player view</li>
  <li>Mobs chase player, no pathfinding if/when obstacles are created in the future</li>
  <li>Player has multiple guns that can be switched between</li>
  <li>Guns have different stats that affect gameplay (firerate/damage etc.)</li>
  <li>Player can level up</li>
  <li>UI changes</li>

  Looked into sprites and decided on art direction (was thinking about pixel/cartoon but ended up using free models from <a href="https://www.mixamo.com/#/">Mixamo</a>

  **Then ended up messing up git version** control and had to backtrack quite a lot to redo things :(

  Next up need to look into level creation, probably in blender
   <li>Barebones main menu and navigation</li>
   <li>Pause menu</li>
   <li>Player model and baseline walking animation</li>
   <li>Zombie model and animation</li>
  <li>Refined some game logics</li>
  <li>Tested out building project into executable</li>
